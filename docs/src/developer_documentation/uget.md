# User Documentation Uenv/Uget

Alexandre Mary et al.

The *uenv/uget* tool developped in Vortex is the counterpart of
*genv/gget* (MF/GCO op team), but user-oriented (hence the **u** instead
of **g**) and shareable with other users. It enables, in Vortex
experiments, to get resources the same way as within an official *genv*
but from your own catalogs or your colleagues.

This tool hence enables to work in research mode the same way as with
official op resources, changing just the *uenv* in the Vortex
experiment.

How does it work ? Quite simple, but a few explanations are necessary to
use it properly.

## Tutorial

The following example shows how to modify components of an Arome-France
*genv* catalog and modify its components piece by piece.

### Before first use

- load Genv/Gget (in your *profile*, if not already done):

  ```bash
  export PATH=/home/mf/dp/marp/gco/public/bin:$PATH
  ```

- load Vortex (in your *profile*, if not already done):

  ```bash
  module load python
  VORTEX_INSTALL_DIR=/home/mf/dp/marp/verolive/vortex/vortex
  PYTHONPATH=$VORTEX_INSTALL_DIR/src:$PYTHONPATH
  PYTHONPATH=$VORTEX_INSTALL_DIR/site:$PYTHONPATH
  PYTHONPATH=$VORTEX_INSTALL_DIR/project:$PYTHONPATH
  export PYTHONPATH
  export PATH=$VORTEX_INSTALL_DIR/bin:$PATH
  ```

- initialisation of directories:

  ```bash
  uget.py bootstrap_hack [user]
  ```

  !!! tip "Example"

      ```bash
      uget.py bootstrap_hack mary
      ```

### Clone an existing env (catalog) {#uget-clone-existant-en}

Syntax:

```bash
uget.py hack genv [cycle_source] into [cycle_cible]@[user]
```

!!! tip "Example"

    ```bash
    uget.py hack genv al42_arome-op2.30 into al42_arome-dble.02@mary
    ```

This "hack" command creates a copy of the genv catalog
(`genv al42_arome-op2.30`), under:
`$HOME/.vortexrc/hack/uget/mary/env/al42_arome-dble.02`.

The initial env can be a GCO official one (genv), or a user one (uenv);
in which case the syntax is slightly different, in order to precise who
we want to get the env from:

```bash
uget.py hack env al42_arome-dble.01@faure into al42_arome-dble.02@mary
```

It is a sort of convention within *uget* : `genv blabla` stands for a
GCO env named `blabla` whereas `env blabla@someone` points to a
user-owned env named `blabla` hosted at `someone`.

### Modification of the cloned env

For each element in the cloned catalog (obtained at step
`uget-clone-existant-en`, we can modify
the the resource (i.e. to the right of the `=`), by pointing at an
element in the "GCO official store", or at a colleague's or one of
your own's (under `$HOME/.vortexrc/hack/uget/$USER/data/`).

We can mix such elements of a *uenv*

!!! tip "Example" 

    I am user `mary`, the element:  `CLIM_FRANMG_01KM30=clim_franmg.01km30.03` (at GCO)
    can be replaced by : `CLIM_FRANMG_01KM30=uget:mes_clims@mary` (`uget:` to identify
    it is an element managed by *uget* and `@mary` because the element is in my store)
    or: `CLIM_FRANMG_01KM30=uget:mes_clims.04@faure` (`@faure` because it is an element stored at user `faure`)

Beware a little difference with `genv` for namelists packages: these
packages being stored as tar/tgz, you need to specify explicitly in the
uenv.

!!! tip "Example" 
    note the extension `.tgz`:

    ```bash
    NAMELIST_AROME=uget:my_namelist_package.tgz@mary
    ```

However, *uget* will be able to get either the directory
`$HOME/.vortexrc/hack/uget/mary/data/my_namelist_package` soit le tgz
`$HOME/.vortexrc/hack/uget/mary/data/my_namelist_package.tgz` (actually,
the most recently modified of both).

We can also add new resources in a *uenv*. The keys (left of the `=`
just need to follow a precise Vortex syntax; for instance for a clim
file: `CLIM_[AREA]_[RESOLUTION]`.

To modify an existing element (e.g. a namelist package), we get it via
uget:

```bash
uget.py hack gdata [element] into [clone_element]@[user]
```

!!! tip "Example"

    ```bash
    uget.py hack gdata al42_arome-op2.15.nam into al42_arome-op2.16.nam.tgz@mary
    ```

    or:

    ```bash
    uget.py hack data al42_arome-dble.01.nam.tgz@faure into al42_arome-op2.16.nam.tgz@mary
    ```

The convention used here by *uget* is consistent with the one used
before: `gdata blabla` stands for a GCO element named `blabla` when
`data blabla@someone` points to a data stored via *uget/uenv*, named
`blabla` and stored at `someone`.

### Historisation

It is a good practice to first check there are no inconsistency within
your *uenv*, i.e. check that all elements listed there actually exist,
either locally or on archive, and at your user, someone else or GCO:

```bash
uget.py check env al42_arome-dble.02@mary
```

Then, to freeze a version and share it with other users, you need to
push the *uenv* to archive:

```bash
uget.py push env al42_arome-dble.02@mary
```

The command (can take a little while) archives the uenv AND the elements
locally present onto archive. It is then strongly recommended to clean
them locally, to avoid to modify something that has been archived and
end up with inconsistencies between local and archived versions:

```bash
uget.py clean_hack
```

Caution: all *uenv* and elements having been pushed are then deleted
locally from directories `env` et `data` !

We may also want to push just one element to make it available before a
whole uenv is ready.

In this case:

```bash
uget.py push data [element]@[user]}
```

!!! tip "Example" 

    ```bash
    uget.py push data al42_arome-op2.16.nam.tgz@mary
    ```

### Explore

*(new in Vortex-1.2.3)*

It is possible to list all uenv existing from a user:

```bash
uget.py list env from faure
```

or the elements, potentially with a filter (based on a regular
expression):

```bash
uget.py list data from faure matching .nam
```

### From one uenv to another

*(new in Vortex-1.2.3)*

It is also possible to compare 2 *uenv*:

```bash
uget.py diff env [cycle_to_compare] wrt env [cycle_reference]
```

Ex:

```bash
uget.py diff env al42_arome-dble.02@mary wrt genv al42_arome-op2.30
```

or:

```bash
uget.py diff env al42_arome-dble.02@mary wrt env al42_arome-dble.01@faure
```

If your uenv has been generated using `uget.py hack`, a comment has been
left in the head of the file to trace its history, and enables you to
use the alias `parent` as:

```bash
uget.py diff env [my_uenv] wrt parent
```

### Export catalog

*(new in Vortex-1.2.3)*

The command `uget.py export` enables to list the elements updated with
regards to a reference, giving their path on the archive.

Ex:

```bash
uget.py export env al42_arome-dble.02@mary [wrt genv al42_arome-op2.30]
```

Remarks and good habits
-----------------------

- clim files (and other monthly resources) are expanded: the key
  `CLIM_BLABLA=uget:my_clims@mary` aim at all files syntaxed
  `my_clims.m??` located in the directory `data` ;
- even if it is technically feasable, it is strongly advised to forbid
  yourself to modify an element once pushed. With the cache system,
  you may face weird fetches in experiments...
- as a corollary, it is a good habit to number each uenv and each
  resource, and increment them push after push
- on hendrix, the *uenv* and resources are archived under an archived
  and spread tree of directories. This is both for performance matters
  and an incitation to use `uget.py` to get these resources
  systematically
- before an element is pushed (uenv and resources), it is not
  accessible via `uget.py` nor a vortex experiment for other users,
  only for the owner.
- if large resources are to be pushed, one can advantageously log on a
  transfer node before the push
- comments are accepted in a *uenv*, starting with `#`.

More advanced functionalities
-----------------------------

### Default user

It can become cumbersome to repeat the user (e.g. `@mary`) in command
lines. Hence a default user can be defined:

```bash
uget.py set location mary
```

The default user can be retrieved with `uget.py info`. Once set, one can
only type:

```bash
uget.py check env al42_arome-dble.02
```

or:

```bash
uget.py diff env al42_arome-dble.02 wrt env al42_arome-dble.01@faure
```

(instead of `uget.py check env al42_arome-dble.02@mary` and
`uget.py diff env al42_arome-dble.02@mary wrt env al42_arome-dble.01@faure`)

However, the user is required inside the uenv file catalog, and in the
experiments.

### Using *uget.py* in console mode

In previous examples, we used `uget.py` via independent successive shell
commands. Another mode exists, using the console mode. To do so, just
type `uget.py` (without arguments) to open the interactive mode (to
quit, use `Ctrl-D`); you can then type commands as following:

```bash
$ uget.py

This mode can be interesting:

- For systems on which loading Vortex is slow, you will load it once
  only in the beginning instead of at each command.
- There is auto-completion (`Tab`).
- Within one session, you can navigate through commands history.
