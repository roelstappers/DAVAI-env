## Experts thresholds

*Experts* are the tools developed to parse outputs of the tasks and
compare them to a reference. Each expert has its expertise field: norms,
Jo-tables, etc\...

See *Information on experts* in the left tab of Ciboula√Ø to get
information about the tunable thresholds of the various experts (e.g.
the allowed error on Jo). Then, set according attributes in the experts
definitions in the concerned tasks.

Again, if you need to modify these, please ***explain and describe in
the integration request***.
