## User configuration

Some more general parameters are configurable, such as the default
directory in which the experiments are stored, or the directory in which
the logs of jobs are put. This can be set in
`~/.davairc/user_config.ini`. If the user, for whatever reason, needs
to modify the packages linked in the experiments on a regular basis, it
is possible to specify that in the same user config file. An example of
these variables is available in the `DAVAI-env` repository, under
`templates/user_config.ini`.
