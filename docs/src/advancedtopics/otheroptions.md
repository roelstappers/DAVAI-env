### Other options

In the `[DEFAULT]` section, a few other general options can be set to
tune the behaviour of the experiment:

-   `expertise_fatal_exceptions` to raise/ignore errors that could occur
    in the expertise subsequent to the tests

-   `drhook_profiling` to activate DrHook profiling or not

-   `ignore_reference` to force to ignore reference outputs (and so
    deactivate comparison)

-   `archive_as_ref` to archive the outputs (saving of a reference only)
